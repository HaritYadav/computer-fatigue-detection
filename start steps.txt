clone object detection api repo- git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git

install coco dependencies

install object detection api

Training Data:
Get Images
Annotate, keep output xml folder same as image src folder
seprate in test and train- use script; go through script's doc
generate tf records using anothr script- commands in adjacent file
create label_map.pbtxt as dict of all labels

Get a model from zoo and edit pipeline.config
reduce resizer to manageable dims so it does not take memory, else crashes
reduce batch size to save memory, else crashes
reduce num steps else takes too long
add checkpoint name to the pre trained model checkpoint to be used
add label map
add train and test record paths

Train model- commands in adjacent file
loss should be around 1

Export model- commands in adjacent file
