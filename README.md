# computer-fatigue-detection
Having worked from home for the past two years, the one constant problem I have face is Computer Fatigue. I have build a prototype using Object Detection API that recognizes the various physical issues manifesting due to computer fatigue. Recognizing conditions like headaches, eye strain etc, appropriate measures can be taken. It can even be increased to recognize fainting, injuries, breathing issues etc. to reduce the time taken in delivering medical care.
